    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <p>While I ultimately decided against a career in Culinary Arts, I have continued to enjoy craft and its creative challenges.
        I have a signature dish for each of the major holidays ranging from the staples like Mac and Cheese to fall of the bone ribs with homemade BBQ. 
        During warmer months I enjoy growing my own vegetables. They never taste better than when you went out back and plucked them of the plant yourself.

    <h3>3d Printing</h3>
    <p>This is a hobby I got into because I wanted to start painting miniatures and playing table top RPGs. 
        I have yet to find a consistant group for game night but I am always ready for adventure.
        It surprised me how many useful things can be printed. From shelving to camera stands, 3d printing has proven to be more than toys and games. </p>
